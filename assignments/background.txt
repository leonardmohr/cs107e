1. 
The bitwise OR operation on 0x0f and 0xff is: 0xff, or 255 in decimal notation.
Left-shifted by 24 results in 0xff000000

2. 
V = I*R (solving for I)
3 = I * 1500
I = 0.002

Name of file in /etc: "memmap"
Number of bytes: 240
There is 1 file and 2 directories
("." referencing /etc and ".." referencing the directory containing /etc)
I used "cd" to change directories, "find . -name 'etc' -print" to find the 
file path leading to /etc, and "ls -l" to see what directories and files are 
contained in /etc along with the number of bytes that the file takes up.
